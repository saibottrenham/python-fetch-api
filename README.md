# Project Assignment
You have been tasked with building a Python app that retrieves input in structured JSON (the 
format of which is to your choosing), validates the input, logs the input to STDOUT, and 
sends a request (the format of which is to your choosing) to a HTTP based API, with the 
input being part of the request message.

architectural & other considerations, that help you arrive at a proposed solution 
* Provide a descriptive overview of the the solution 
* Document challenges, considerations, requirements

    * You can also provide a Go Playground link, if you prefer
* Feel free to provide diagrams, and other material, as relevant to support your
